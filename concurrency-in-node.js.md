## Nodejs event loop

Node Js Run Javacript in a single thread.

a hidden threads run Non Blocking I/O operations.

the hidden thread can't overload CPU intensive tasks beacuse it will block the main thread.
note that turning heavly intensive calculation into promise to make the code non blocking. as we leanrned about using non-blocking promise-based I/O methods like file opration wont  make use of Node.js hidden threads.
 
=> promises donâ€™t make JavaScript code execute in parallel and cannot be used to make CPU-bound tasks non-blocking.

Event loop

* call Stack
* Queue referd also as task queue or message queue

* Memery heap

JavaScript introduced Promises and async functions to execute code without blocking the thread during I/O like network calls or reading files etc using event loop instead of waiting till the operation is complete. Once the operation is complete it resolves. NodeJS uses libuv to manage the event loop and I/O operations.

It is crucial for Node.js developers to know how the event loop works because the event loop is a fundamental concept in Node.js that is responsible for handling I/O operations and managing concurrency. Understanding how the event loop works is important because it allows developers to write efficient and non-blocking code that can handle multiple requests simultaneously without causing the application to freeze or crash.

In Node.js, the event loop is responsible for handling all the asynchronous I/O operations, such as network requests, file system operations, and database queries. These operations are executed in the background, allowing the application to continue processing other requests without waiting for the I/O operation to complete. When an I/O operation is complete, the event loop notifies the application, allowing it to process the result.

By understanding the event loop, Node.js developers can write code that takes advantage of this asynchronous behavior and avoids blocking the event loop. This ensures that the application can handle multiple requests simultaneously without causing performance issues or crashes.

Additionally, understanding the event loop is important for debugging and troubleshooting Node.js applications. By understanding how the event loop works, developers can identify and resolve issues related to blocking I/O operations or inefficient code that could be causing performance issues.
