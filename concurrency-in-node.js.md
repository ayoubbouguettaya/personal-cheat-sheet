## Nodejs event loop

Node Js Run Javacript in a single thread.

a hidden threads run Non Blocking I/O operations.

the hidden thread can't overload CPU intensive tasks beacuse it will block the main thread.
note that turning heavly intensive calculation into promise to make the code non blocking. as we leanrned about using non-blocking promise-based I/O methods like file opration wont  make use of Node.js hidden threads.
 
=> promises donâ€™t make JavaScript code execute in parallel and cannot be used to make CPU-bound tasks non-blocking.

Event loop

* call Stack
* Queue referd also as task queue or message queue

* Memery heap

JavaScript introduced Promises and async functions to execute code without blocking the thread during I/O like network calls or reading files etc using event loop instead of waiting till the operation is complete. Once the operation is complete it resolves. NodeJS uses libuv to manage the event loop and I/O operations.
